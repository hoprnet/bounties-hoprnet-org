For the majority of the bounties, the only reward should be the bounty prize set in accordance with the [bounty process](https://github.com/hoprnet/hoprnet/blob/master/.processes/bounty.md). When a bounty hunter goes beyond the bounty’s scope, it is possible to reward that with a tip in the form of a higher payment or an NFT.
